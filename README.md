## About CS50

[CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is Harvard University's introduction to computer science and programming. The course teaches about how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Course teaches the languages ​​C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks such as Python's Flask.

## Disclaimer about academic honesty

Please read [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) about the course academic honesty policy. The intention of this repository is not to be a source of answers or to encourage academic dishonesty.

Best approach in general is to try to solve the challenges on your own, with research concentrated on the documentation and official examples of the specific bits and pieces you are investigating, not someone else's complete solutions. Also, to enjoy the process and learn to have fun with it.

Please bear in mind that I'm also a beginner and my solutions are not by any means examples of best practices. I left most of my original in-code comments as much for myself as for anyone who can gain some use of them. Best of luck!
