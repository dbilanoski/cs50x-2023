## Intro
Computer science
  * Generally about problem solving
  * Take input and produce output

### Numerical systems for mapping and patterning

Binary system 
  * How to convert it to decimal
    * 001 = 1
    * 010 = 2
    * 011 = 3
    * 100 = 4
    * 110 = 6
    * 111 = 7
    * etc.  
  * How it controls electricity with ones and zeros
  * Out of practicality, 8 bits 1 byte etc.

Number systems used to represent symbols such as letters - binary > decimal > some unique decimal number will be some letter. Further mapping developed to a standard - [ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). Wider standardizations move forward in numbers to cover more symbols, such as [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).

Example (text > decimal > binary)

|Text   |H        |I      |!       |
|:------|:--------|:------|:-------|
|Decimal| 72      | 73    |33      |
|Binary |01001000|01001001|00100001|

Colors are also represented by combination of numbers in models such as [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), where you level amonts of red, green and blue to get a color with numbers.
  * Red = rgb(255,2,0)
  * Orange = rgb(253, 58, 0)
  * Black = rgb(0, 0, 0)
  * etc.

Audio also has models for mapping numbers to sounds, such as [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI).


### Algorithms

Collection of rules to solve a problem or produce a certain expected output by taking some input and applying the algorighm logic. 

Things to consider about algorighm are performace and efficiency, where the goal is to have the time needed for completion increases as little as possible in relation to the "size" of the given input. Example - when seaching the phonebook for a name, you want the search time to be the same no matter how long the phonebook gets.

Pseudocode is a good way to describe logic prior to using programatic syntax, meaning writing steps of the algorithm in plain language.

Constructs of programming languages which are universal regardless of the language:
* Variables
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions

## Scratch

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a graphical block based visual programing language for children and beginners.  

## Lecture Challenge
Build something complex in Scratch. I'll do Space Invaders.
